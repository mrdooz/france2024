### New York to Paris

To avoid having to be picked up at 2AM for our early morning flight we decided to spend the night before at the airport hotel. Now we only need to get from terminal 4 to terminal 5 before checkin!<br>
Since we are arriving late in the evening to Paris our only goal is to get to our hotel!

### Paris

Good Morning Paris!!! Not such a bad place to celebrate your birthday!<br>
Time to explore the city. We'll start off with a bang!<br> 
- First stop is Arc de Triomphe followed by a visit to the Eiffel Tower and some champagne! We'll try to catch a light lunch on our walk between the two somewhere in the Trocadera neighbourhood.
- To get to our next stop of the day we plan to catch the Seine hop-on hop-off ferry. We'll hop off at the [Cathédrale Notre-Dame](https://www.notredamedeparis.fr/en/), unfortunately is still closed so we will not be able to tour it, instead we will view if from outside and then walk over to [Sainte-Chapelle](https://www.sainte-chapelle.fr/en) and [the Conciergerie](https://www.paris-conciergerie.fr/en) for a visit.  
- To round off the day we'll catch some dinner in the Latin Quarters before heading back to the hotel and some well needed rest.

Today we'll venture outside of the city with a visit to [Chateau Versailles](https://en.chateauversailles.fr/)<br><br>
If we have any spare time in the afternoon we might catch up on any places left out from yesterday.<br>

### Paris to Dijon

Today it's time to leave Paris and start our journey south. We'll pick up our rental car and drive to Dijon where we will spend the night.<br><br>
When we planned our trip to France we signed up for the [Passion monuments card](https://www.monuments-nationaux.fr/en/passion-monuments-subscription). The card includes free access to more than 90 castles, abbeys, private mansions, villas, archaeological sites across France. This gives us the perfect excuse to stop at places we otherwise might have skipped.<br>
One such place between Paris and Dijon is [Château de Bussy-Rabutin](https://www.chateau-bussy-rabutin.fr/en) where we might make a stop, however, they are closed between 12-2pm so it will all depend on our timing<br><br>
Once we get to Dijon our plan is to explore the city on foot and most likely take a self guided audio tour.

Along the route to Lyon we'll most likely make a stop at another of the Passion Monement sites, [Monastère royal de Brou in Bourg-en-Bresse](https://www.monastere-de-brou.fr/en). 
For the evening in Lyon we have booked a [Food tour](https://www.viator.com/tours/Lyon/Explore-Downtown-Lyons-Food-Scene-with-a-Local-Food-Guide/d829-75909P900) to get familiar with the area.

### Avignon to Gordes
Originally we were supposed to stay 4 nights in Avignon but when we received the hotel suggestions from Arianna at [sarahwlee.com](https://www.sarahwlee.com/) both of the hotel options looked amazing so we simply had to split our stay in 2 and ended up adding Gordes to our itinerary!<br>
On the way there we will first go in the opposite direction to and check out the Roman Aqueduct [Pont du Gard](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/344/).

### Hike and/or relax

Today is one of those days without a set agenda.<br>
If we are in the right mood we might drive south to the Alpilles Natural Park for a hike. But, most likely we will just stay in Gordes, walking around the village, borrowing some E-bikes from the hotel, ordering a picnic in the gardens and simply just relax at this beautiful hotel.
