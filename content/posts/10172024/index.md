## Bonjour!

[Chateau Versailles](https://en.chateauversailles.fr/)

Our tour started at 8:15 with Claudio picking us up outside of our hotel. He was a wealth of knowledge and the guided tour started as soon as we 
got into the car with some facts about the square we live at, Place des Vosges. He also drove like a true Frenchman, mumbling and swearing at other
drivers.<br>
Our destination for the day was <a href="https://en.chateauversailles.fr">Chateau Versailles</a> about 1 hour west of Paris.<br>
Chateau Versailles was huge, even though we were told it was much smaller than the previous royal palace (The Louvre)!<br>
Our guide was awesome and explained the history and how all the paintings inside the Chateau correlated to it, he definately added a lot to the visit.<br>
<br>
Once done inside it was time to visit the gardens and all its fountains. We gave it our best in the pouring rain and took a short stroll through the garden. 
A visit in the summer I think would be absolutely amazing but the highlight in the rain was the small kiosk that sold crepes!

Once back in the city we were starving and we headed for a small restaurant on our local square followed by an afternoon rest to catch up on some jet lag.<br>
We dared the medium rain to run to the store to pick up some breakfast for tomorrow, on our way back the sky opened up we got completely soaked! 
After getting some dry cloths at the hotel we ventured out for our final dinner in Paris!
