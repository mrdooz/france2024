After breafast we left Avignon and drove to <a hreff="(https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/344/">Pont du Gard</a>, a huge roman aqueduct built in the middle of the 1st century (that's really really old!).<br>
We have seen aqueducts before but this one took the prize with its three levels. Thanks to the attached road bridge from 1746 it's also possible to walk along the aqueduct to cross the river. On the opposite side we found a cafe and had lunch with a beautiful backdrop!

The next destination for the day was <a href="https://www.avignon-et-provence.com/en/tourism-provence/gordes">Gordes</a>, that's also where our next hotel, <a href="https://airelles.com/en/destination/gordes-hotel">Arielles Gordes La Bastides</a>,  was located.<br>
Based on the hotel web site our expectations were already pretty high, regardless, when we arrived we were simply blown away by the small town and the absolutely serene hotel that we won't want to leave, ever!<br>
<br>
When reaching our upgraded room (valley view instead of village view) we noticed a small birthday cake and card as a small belated birthday celebration!

After taking in the breath taking views from our hotel room and from all the different patios at the hotel we took a short stroll along the cobbel stone alleys in Gordes before enjoying a delicious dinner at the hotel restaurant Lâ€™Orangerie.
