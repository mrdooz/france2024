To learn a bit about Aix, we had booked a food tour over lunch since they usually cover quite a bit of history as well walking from place to place.<br>
<br>
We met Inga, our Scottish guide at the Fontaine de la Rotonde at 10:45. It turned out we were the only participants so it turned into a private tour!<br>
First stop was a truffles shop wher we got to taste different truffle mixes and salts, yummy! That was followed by a small charcuterie shop, Maison D'Amore where we got to taste some nice ham and cheese along with a glass of wine.<br>
When we were inside the shop the rain started to come down and our guide decided we should wait it out where we were and poured us another glass of wine.<br>
It took a while before the rain subsided and we could move on to the next stop but it finally did.<br>
Now it was time for the actual lunch part of the tour, a Croque Monsieur Truffel at La Fromagerie du Passage along with another glass of wine! At this point it's turning into a wine tour with food.<br>
Last stop of the tour was a small p√¢tisserie at Maison Riederer.<br><br>
The tour took much longer than planned and we didnt get back to the hotel until 3:15 and after all the wine it was time for a nap!

In the evening our plan was to walk into town and find a small nice place for a light dinner. But, when we exited the door at the hotel the rain was once again pouring down, and to avoid getting completely soaked we decided to give the hotel restaurant a try. 3 courses later and some extra bites it was time for bed.
