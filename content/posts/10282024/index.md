If I didn't already knew that the view from the hotel restaurant was even better than the view from the room I'm not sure I would have left bed at all today.<br>
Weather was great this morning and we could enjoy breakfast outside at the patio. We didn't really want to leave but we knew we had to get moving or we would sit there the whole day!

After breakfast we left for the town of St Tropez. It was as lovely little town and I can see what all the fuss is about.<br>
Downside is the with all the fuss comes the bumped up prices.<br>
We strolled around for a while, had lunch and checked out some art.

On the way back to the hotel we stopped by the <a href="https://www.seesainttropez.com/reserves/cap-camarat-golfe-de-696097">Cape Camarat lighthouse</a>. 
There are trails all the way down to the see from the light house but we only trecked a little way down, enought for some pretty views but short enought to not be exhausted by the climb back up to the car.

Since there is nothing else close to our hotel (up on a hill) we once again had dinner at the hotel restaurant. 
Today we opted for the leg of lamb for 2 to share. Could easily have been shared by 3-4 people, but we did our best to nom it all up!
