Since our flight wasn't scheduled until 18:30 we had planned to check out the <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/e/planets/">teamLab Planets Exhibition</a>, and since the rain was pouring down we decided to splurge and take a taxi.<br>
We arrived abour 5 min before they opened and the line was already enormous! After about 20min in the pouring rain it was finally our turn to get inside.

Since we already visited <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/e/borderless-azabudai/">teamLab Borderless</a> during our first time around in Tokyo we we're not sure how much would be the same. Luckily only one of the artworks was the same and one slightly similar.<br><br>
All in all, it was definitely worth visiting both of them since they are quite different experiences!<br> 
I specifically loved the orchid room at Planets!

Back at the hotel we had a quick lunch, finished our packing, left the awesome room and returned our keys!<br> 
Time for a taxi to the airport!
