Woho, another wine tour was on the agenda today! And this time there was plenty of tasty wine!<br>
<br>
We met our guide Romain from <a href="https://www.lenezdespapes.wine/">le Nez des Papes</a> next to Palais des Papes for our early morning pickup at 9:30.<br>
Today we were 6 happy tourists embarking on the tour which started with the drive north to Châteauneuf du Pape and the wineyards.<br>

Our first stop was at <a href="https://www.chateaudevaudieu.com/en/home/">Chateau de Vaudieu</a> where we first stopped at one of the plots to admire the views, the vines, taste some leftover grapes and learn about the growing of the grapes, the special condions (soil & weather) and the appelation rules for Châteauneuf du Pape. <br>
When properly educated we continued to the Chateau for a tour of the wine making facilities. 
The Chateau from 1767 was specifically built for wine and the building and the cave was pretty impressive.<br>
We also got to taste 6 of their wines, 3 white and 3 red and they were all very very tasty! We might end up ordering 4 of them!<br>
Next we stopped at <a href="https://www.domaine-usseglio-pierre.com/en/">Domain Usseglio</a> where we tasted another 4 excelent wines (and that's before lunch!).
From here we might only order one of them.

Then it was time for lunch and Romain drove us to <a href="https://chateaufinesroches.com/en/le-chateau">Hostellerie du Château des Fines Roches</a>. 
A simply beautiful place where we actually considered staying for a night or two but opted out from since it was so far outside the city!
What a bummer, that would have been absolutely awesome!<br>
Anyhow, we had an absolutely amazing lunch with awesome views over Châteauneuf du Pape.

Having recovered a bit by the food it was time for the third wineyard, this time we went to <a href="https://www.domainesrichard.fr/chateau-la-nerthe/en/">Château La Nerthe</a>.
We toured their impressive facilities and got to taste their 4 wines. They were all excellent and it was really great that we got to taste the same
wine but from 2 different years which make you really notice the difference weather and age makes.<br> And we will most likely order a few bottles from here as well!
<br><br>
For the final wineyard of the tour, Romain took us to <a href="https://beaurenard.fr/en/">Domain de Beaurenard</a>, a family owned biodynamic wineyard with yet more excelent wines!
<br><br>
Tired and happy after a very successful day with lots of great wine we were returned to Avignon around 17:00, and got an Uber with a pretty funny driver, who started by yelling at his mum because apparently she was supposed to give him some chocolate, but instead he got some weird badge. We didn't really understand what was going on, but it was funny none the less. When we told him we were from Sweden, he said that he knew about Stockholm, and also snus. But we told him to stop snusing, or we'd tell his mum! <br>
Back at the hotel, it was time for a short rest, before it was dinner o'clock again!
