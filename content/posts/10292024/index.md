After yet another wonderful breakfast it was time to drive to our final hotel, La Perouse in Nice. As usual we were avoiding the highways and followed the sea as much as we could so it basically took the whole day to get there.<br>
We stopped alot along the way and ejoyed the views but it was hard to find a restaurant open for lunch. We finally found some open places in Th√©oule-sur-Mer and found a really good small restaurant on a side street.

Tired after a long day of driving we arrived at our hotel and went out for an early dinner before crashing for the day.
