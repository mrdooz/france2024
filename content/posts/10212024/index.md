Today was a lazy day, with the only real objective to get to Avignon, about a 2.5h drive away. We left Lyon pretty uneventfully, and hit the road. We had to stop for gas along the way, and I panicked a little when we noticed that Shell didn't want to accept any of our credit cards! But luckily the was another gas station a couple miles down the road, and all was good again!

We arrived in Avignon and checked into our hotel, and then zoomed into town to try to make the 14.00-15.00 reservation we had made to the 14:th century <a href="https://palais-des-papes.com/en/">Palais des papes</a>, a massive fortress and palace, in the center of Avignon. We arrived about 15 minutes late, but luckily everyone manning the ticket scanners was nice, and they let us in! Yay! It was a maaaaasive complex, and well worth visiting.

We headed back to our hotel, and chilled for an hour or so, before it was time for dinner, which was pretty yummy, even if we almost exploded from chocolate in the end!
