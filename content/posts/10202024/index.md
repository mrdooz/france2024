It was finally time for our first wine tour, a half day tour to the Beaujolais region with our guide Clémence from Tasty Lyon.<br>
Along with 5 other happy tourists and a photographer from GetYourGuide we set off towards our first stop in Fleurie, 
<a href="https://chateau-bachelards.com/">Château des Bachelards</a>. The wineyard was absolutely fabolous but unfortunately neither of us appriciated the Beaujolais wines since they must use the Gamay grapes to label it Beaujolais.<br>
<br>
Next stop was Château Portier in Moulin À Vent, also a beautiful wineyard with amazing views but not so amazing wine.

Once back in the city we were quite tired (and a little tipsy) so we opted for lunch at our hotel before heading to the room for a nap.<br>
<br>
Once our energy returned we ventured out in Lyon once again with our sight set on the <a href="https://www.fourviere.org/en/">Basilica of Notre Dame of Fourvière</a>.<br>
To get there you take the Funicular (a type of cable railway used on steep slopes) up the hill. You end up right infront of the Basilica, it's even bigger that what it looks like from below!<br>
When we got there there was a mass in progress so we were not allowed to take any pictures inside but it was quite impressive!<br>
Outside, behind the basilica you also got an amazing view over Lyon.

For dinner we headed over to <a href="https://traveltrade.lyon-france.com/en/discover-lyon/">Les Halles de Lyon Paul Bocuse</a>, it was on the opposite side of the city center so it was quite a walk. When we got there we found out it closed 16:30 at Sundays so tired and hungry we turned and walked back towards our hotel neighbourhood.<br> 
We found an awesome burger place and we quickly forgot about our tired legs.
