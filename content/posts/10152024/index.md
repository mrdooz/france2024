## Good morning Paris!

We decided to mix up our itinerary and set our sights on <a href="https://www.jardindesplantesdeparis.fr/en">Jardin des Plantes</a> instead. It's always nice to wander around in a park with flowers in the middle of a huge city! While there, we also popped in to the zoo to say a quick hello to the animals!

A morning full of walking makes you hungry. We found a peruvian restaurant (<a href="https://www.the3musketeersgroup.com/?lang=en">The 3 Musketeers</a>) that according to Google only had top reviews, when a place has that high rating it's fake 9/10 times but we were lucky and this was the one exception where the reviews were spot on! It was a really small place with 5 tables and we were alone for most of our lunch. The food was amazing and we will add to the 5 star reviews!

When already in the neighborhood we decided to also stop by <a href="https://www.paris-pantheon.fr/en)">Panth√©on</a>. Wow, that's a massive building, very impressive, and the crypt was spectacular! If we ever build a house with a cellar, it will be like the crypt!<br>
But, the best part was the view from the top as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum">Foucault pendulum</a> demonstrating the Earth's rotation!

Tonight it was time for a proper birthday dinner, we had secured a spot at <a href="https://table.paris/">Table by Bruno Verjus</a>, the 3rd best restaurant in the world 2024 according to "The World's 50 Best".<br>
They did not dissapoint and we were joined at the restaurant by Nancy Silverton, a famous american chef, baker, restaurateur, and author. She's a frequent judge on top cooking shows and all chefs are afraid of her!
