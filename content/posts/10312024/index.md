I wont lie, my absolute favorite luxury indulgence is riding a HELICOPTER!!!! It simply fills me with joy and it's so exiting I can barely sit/stand still!<br><br>
So, to round off our fabulous vacation in France we took a helicopter to Monaco for the day.

Once in Monaco we took a taxi to the Casino, we were however a tad too early, gambling didn't start until 14:00 so we decided to check our the famous Grand prix track Hairpin bend, with real skid marks and all!<br>
Continuing down the hill we made a quick visit to Princess Grace Japanese Garden before ending up down by the beach. Weather was lovely and we almost regretted not bringing our bathing suits. <br> 

 Next we jumped on a Hop-on-Hop-off bus. It was great, we got to see a lot more than if we would have only walked. And, to top it off, once our bus reached the Prince's Palace it was right on time for the changing of the guards! And, being on the second floor of the bus we could see it all above all the tourists that were crowded around the placa.<br>
 We left the bus once it reached the port and went looking for some lunch. We found a great Italian pasta place which we followed up with some ice cream!

It was now past 14:00 and we set off to the casino to make some money, someone needs to pay the credit card bill once we get back home!<br>
No photos were allowed on the casino floor and we only managed to win back the entrance fee, so no extra money for us this time either.

When done at the casino we once again took a cab to the heliport for our return trip back to Nice. And, it was as exiting as the first ride!
