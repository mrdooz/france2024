We dit not need to look far for breakfast today, around 8am, coffe and croissants was placed outside our hotel door, one of the special treats offered at this hotel. <br>
Once ready to venture out we set off towards the iconic Cable Car. The Cable Car, that has been operating since 1902, takes you from the heart of the city centre, up the hillside to Kelburn, from where you can lookout over the city.

From the top of the Cable Car in Kelburn it takes about 30 min to walk to Zealandia, a fully-fenced urban ecosanctuary. 
The conservation project has reintroduced 18 species of native wildlife back into the area. <br>
Zealandia offers a great environmnet for a good walk with the added bonus of encountering some wildlife, we got to see some Kākā (bush parrot), Takahē (flightless & only found in New Zealand) and Tuatara (nocturnal reptiles with a distinct crest of spines along its back).

Also at the top of the Cable Car is one end of the Wellington Botanical garden. We decided to walk down through the garden instead of riding back down with the Cable Car. <br>
The Botanical Garden offered beatiful flowers along the winding walkways on the way down to the city center.

Todays dinner was enjoyed at Logan & Brown, a restaurant housed in an old bank building. Magnus was really happy and I thought it was just fine (might have been the surprise pickles/candid cherries that came with my dishes).
