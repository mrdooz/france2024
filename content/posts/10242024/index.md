With warnings of an afternoon thunderstorm we were quick to decide to stay at our beautiful hotel and settle for a day of relaxation!<br>
Armed with some candy from the mini bar and water we settled in the garden with a book and took in the view. When it was time for lunch we had to drag ourselves away and climb one set of stairs to enjoy lunch at the terrace just above.

With our energy reserves filled up we opted for a walk to the opposite site of the valley, taking in the enormous views of Gordes. Just as we reached the other side the rain arrived but we made it back without getting to badly soaked.

For dinner we once again opted for the hotel restaurant L’Orangerie. Today they had a special event "Dinner for 6 hands" where L’Orangerie's executive chef Yohan Fatela was joined by micheline-starred executive chef Fanny Rey (L'Auberge de Saint-Remy) and micheline-starred pastry Chef Jonathan Wahid, french dessert champion. <br>
Even this time dinner was amazing, and we left very happy, and on the brink of exploding! Luckily the journey to our room is only about 20 meters (and an elevator ride).
