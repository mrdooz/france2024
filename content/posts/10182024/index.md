In the morning we had an early(ish) breakfast, and headed off to the train station to pick up out rental car. Once we found the counter, they started going over the contract, and I noticed that they had given us a Mini Cooper. Considering that we had two large bags and 3 carry-ons, this wasn't quite going to cut it! Turns out that we had gotten an upgrade from the car we wanted, and the upgrade just happened to be tiny. Luckily it was an easy thing to give us a larger car, and we ended up with a pretty neat Renault SUV. <br>
We drove back to the hotel, loaded our bags, and headed off towards Dijon. But first we had to make it out of Paris traffic, which we did (yay Malin!), but roundabouts in Paris are no joke! <br>

We took a slight detour instead of heading straight to Dijon, and drove by [Château de Bussy-Rabutin](https://www.chateau-bussy-rabutin.fr/en), and it was well worth the visit. This is an old Chateau from the 14:th century set on some beautiful surroundings, and it was really peaceful just walking around the place. Four very enthusiastic thumbs up!

We arrived in Dijon around 17.00, and took our bags up to our room. And then it was time to take a stroll in the city and find some place to eat. Dijon had a pretty charming city center, and we found a place called Dr Wine that had two dinner options, the white wine or the red wine option. We both opted for the red wine option, and after three nice plates of pig, and a couple glasses of wine, it was time to head back to the hotel for some well needed rest. <br><br>

In the morning we grabbed some breakfast, and headed out for a self-guided audio tour (from VoiceMap), that was pretty neat. It took about an hour, and walked us around the city center pointing out things that we would otherwise have missed. <br>

After this, it was time to load our stuff back into the car, and start driving south towards our next destination!
