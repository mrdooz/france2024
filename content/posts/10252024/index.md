Sadly we had to leave Gordes and our awesome hotel,it was time for the next destination.<br>
After a very slow morning we got in the car and set off towards the our next stop, Aix-en-Provence. As usual we opted to avoid the toll roads and choose the smaller and slower country side roads.<br>
It's amazing how much extra you get to see when  you choose the less wandered path, suddely we drove into a small hillside town, climbing upwards on 2 way narrow bumpy streets not allowing for oncoming traffic. The village we passed through was Bonnieux, a small village with just over 1000 people.<br>
We also got to see some very nice views of the french country side before we reached out destination.<br>
The new hotel was also very nice and the room is great, but we will defiantely miss the views in Gordes.

Once settled into our room we went out to explore the city. A very charming town with old houses and narrow streets. We walked around without any special agenda and just enjoyed the stroll.
