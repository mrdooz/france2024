We left Dijon much later than we originally planned since we did the walking tour in the morning, we wouldn't have time to make the extra stop on the way south towards Dijon but to avoid taking the highway all the way we choose to take a non-toll road instead. It added quite some extra time but gifted us with some really nice views of the French country side as we passed through small villages and fields.<br>
<br>  
When we got hungry we stopped for lunch in one of the larger villages, Louhans and found a local pub that served some decent pasta. Nobody there spoke English, but we managed to order food just fine anyway!

We reched out hotel around 4, perfect time to check in, fresh up and get going to the food tour we booked for the evening.<br>
We met our guide Huda and 3 other couples in Dijon's old town. The tour started with some cheese and wine at a cheese restaurant. On the way to the next stop Huda told us about Lyon's history, we checked out some old Traboules (narrow passageways/short cuts through buildings between streets). Next we stopped for some sausages and wine, next followed Lyon Pike Quenelle in lobster bisque, and to round it all off we finished with some (maybe too many?) drinks.<br>
It was a great tour with great company!
