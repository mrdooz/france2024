On our way towards St Tropez and the Mediterranean we continued to avoid highways as much as possible!<br>
It was a great drive despite the rain and we stopped a few times along the way to enjoy the views.<br>

We reached our new hotel around 4 and was amazed by the views. Later we enjoyed some great food in the hotel restaurant before heading to bed totally exhausted from doing basically nothing!
