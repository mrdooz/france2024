## And the trip is on!

Since our flight departed from JFK at 8:15AM we would have had to leave the house around 3AM to get there in time. To avoid this we decided to spend the night at the <a href="https://www.twahotel.com/">TWA airport hotel</a> instead.<br>
The hotel is housed in the old TWA Flight Center (built 1962) along with two new hotel room wings that opened in 2019. The hotel lobby has a lot of memoribelia on display and looks pretty cool.<br>

After a restless night's sleep (never sleep well before a flight since I think I will sleep through the alarm and miss the flight) it only took us about 20min to get from the hotel at terminal 5 to check in and our flight at terminal 4! <br>
Definately worth not leaving home at 3AM!<br>
<br>

After a smooth flight we arrived in Paris as scheduled and took a taxi to the hotel. The night butler missread the date for my birthday and showed up with 2 glasses of Champagne to celebrate me!
